## My process
I completed the html first and then proceeded to the CSS. Occasionally, I went back to the html to make changes or make additions where necessary.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had a hard time centering the QR Code to the center of the page, after a while I realised the problem was with the attribution text, it was sitting right beside the QR Code so whenever I tried to center it, it would distort it. Also realised that I had to link different font weights for it to reflect in the project.

```css

footer {
 position: absolute;
 bottom: 0;
}

### Continued development

I definitely want to get better with the flexbox property.
